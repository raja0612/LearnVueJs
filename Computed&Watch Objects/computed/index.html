  <p>Counter : {{ counter }}</p>
  <p>Second Counter : {{ secondCounter }}</p>
  <p>{{ result() }} | {{ output }}</p>

  <!-- when index.html is loaded first time.

    1. {{ counter }} expression is evaluated.

    2. {{ secondCounter }} expression is evaluated.

    3. result () and output methods will be executed.



    when we click on either Increase or Decrease button  result() and output will be executed.

    because both these vue js methods accessing the counter variable.

    but when we click on Increase Second button only  secondCounter value and result() function

    will be executed. because result() function  will be executed every time.

    but computed property {{ output }} will not be executed, because the computed property of 

    vue js methods observing only counter varibale .It doesnot know about secondCounter data property.

    so computed property will only excute only when particular data properties of vue js instance has been chnaged.
